Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter 
series. She initially appears in the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's 
Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a 
mountain troll in the girls' toilets, she becomes close friends with them and often 
uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to help them. Rowling 
has stated that Hermione resembles her at a younger age, with her insecurity and 
fear of failure.<br>
