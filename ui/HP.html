Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author 
J. K. Rowling. The series chronicles the adventures of a young wizard, Harry 
Potter, the titular character, and his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione 
Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's quest to overcome the Dark 
wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become immortal, conquer the wizarding 
world, subjugate non-magical people, and destroy all those who stand in his 
way, especially Harry Potter.</p>

Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 
on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and 
commercial success worldwide.The series has also had some share of criticism, 
including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed. As of 
May 2015, the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making the 
series the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into 73 
languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling 
books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 11 million copies in 
the United States within the first 24 hours of its release.

A series of many genres, including fantasy, coming of age and the British school 
story (with elements of mystery, thriller, adventure and romance), it has many 
cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. 
There are also many other themes in the series, such as prejudice and corruption.

The series was originally printed in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury 
in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. The books have 
since been published by many publishers worldwide.<b><u><strong> The books, with the 
seventh book split into two parts, have been made into an eight-part film series by 
Warner Bros.</b></u></strong> Pictures, the highest-grossing film series as of October 
2014. The series also originated much tie-in merchandise, making the Harry Potter brand 
worth in excess of $15 billion.<br>
Because of the success of the books and films, Harry Potter-themed areas, known 
as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been created at several Universal 
Parks & Resorts theme parks.

The novels revolve around Harry Potter, an orphan who discovers at the age of 11 that he 
is a wizard, living within the ordinary world of non-magical people, known as Muggles. 
The wizarding world is secret from the Muggle world, presumably to avoid persecution of 
witches and wizards. His ability is inborn, and such children are invited to attend an 
exclusive magic school that teaches the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. 
Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and it is here where 
most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he 
learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary 
teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation and exams, and the greater test of preparing 
himself for the confrontation in the real world that lies ahead.

Each book chronicles one year in Harry's life with the main narrative being set in the years 1991 to 98. 
The books also contain many flashbacks, which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories 
of other characters in a device called a Pensieve.<br>
The environment Rowling created is completely separate from reality yet also intimately connected to it. 
While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternative universe and the Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth a 
mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within the real world and contains 
magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life. Many of its institutions and locations are 
recognisable, such as London. It comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient 
pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles that remain invisible to the Muggle population.

In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly 
"fell into her head". Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying"I had been 
writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. 
I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, 
and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more 
real to me."

Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began 
holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication 
of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, 
and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in 
attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of 
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours. The final book in the series, Harry 
Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in 
the first twenty-four hours of release. The series has also gathered adult fans, leading to the release 
of two editions of each Harry Potter book, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed 
at children and the other aimed at adults. Besides meeting online through blogs, podcasts, and fansites, 
Harry Potter super-fans can also meet at Harry Potter symposia.<br>
The word Muggle has spread beyond its Harry Potter origins, becoming one of few pop culture words to land 
in the Oxford English Dictionary.The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular, often weekly, 
insight to the latest discussion in the fandom. Both MuggleCast and PotterCast have reached the top spot of 
iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favourite podcasts.
