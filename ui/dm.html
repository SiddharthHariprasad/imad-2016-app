Draco Lucius Malfoy is a character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. He 
is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is 
frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, 
who act as henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who manipulates 
and hurts people to get what he wants; nevertheless, he is a cunning user of magic. 
He was played by Tom Felton in the Harry Potter film series.<br>
