Lord Voldemort  (born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's 
Harry Potter series. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 
which was released in 1997. Voldemort appeared either in person or in flashbacks in each book 
and film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 
where he is mentioned.<br>
In the series, Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the 
power to vanquish the Dark Lord". Almost no witch or wizard dares to speak his name, instead 
referring to him by epithetssuch as "You-Know-Who", "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" or "the Dark Lord". 
Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle 
(non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood 
dominance. Through his mother's family, he is the last descendant of wizard Salazar Slytherin, 
one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the leader of the 
Death Eaters, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of 
Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.<br>
