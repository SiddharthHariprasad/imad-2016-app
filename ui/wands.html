(Harry's wand)<br>
A wand is a wooden stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus increase 
its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands are used as both 
tools and weapons in the wizarding world. They are thus an important aspect of nearly 
all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried 
inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also 
be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his 
wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in 
his cane. In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are 
snapped in half. This type of damage to a wand is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able 
to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, with the help of the powerful 
Elder Wand.<br>

A wand is made by a wandmaker who is learned in wandlore, the study of wands. Wands are 
handcrafted from high-quality woods, or "wandwoods", which are capable of sustaining magic 
(e.g. holly, yew, ebony, vinewood, mahogany, cherry, oak, etc.). A core is then inserted 
into the middle of the wand from top to bottom. Common cores include phoenix tail feathers, 
unicorn tail hairs, and dragon heartstrings. Veela hair is also used, but less commonly. In 
the Deathly Hallows, the Elder Wand is described as the only wand with a core made from the 
tail hair of a Thestral.The only wand shop seen in the books is Ollivanders. Garrick Ollivander 
is a wandmaker who has an eidetic memory concerning wands, as well as the ability to identify the 
distinguishing features of a wand. <br>

A wand is generally considered a very personal object. Wands belonging to other wizards can be 
borrowed, resulting in a comparatively less potent effect. In Philosopher's Stone, Harry had to 
try out many wands before he found one that "chose him." Wands with cores from the same source 
give strange effects (Priori Incantatem) when forced to fight each other, as is the case with 
Harry and Voldemort's wands. In Goblet of Fire, it is revealed each of their wands contains a 
tail feather from Fawkes, the phoenix belonging to Dumbledore. After Priori Incantatem, the wands 
get to know the opposites' master, as explained in Deathly Hallows. While, according to Ollivander, 
any object can channel magic if the wizard is strong enough, wands are the most commonly used because 
of their efficiency (due to the owner's bond with the wand itself). This can explain how some wizards 
are able to use spells without wands (for example, retrieving an item with Accio).Furthermore, wands 
are able to be won from a witch or wizard and can therefore change their allegiance. This is the case 
when Harry takes Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, and consequently the wand's allegiance swaps to Harry, 
as explained by Ollivander; and, by extension, so does the allegiance of the Elder Wand,which itself 
has changed hands many times.<br>
